# GhostDirective — Stealth PoC

Security research by [Bountyy Oy](https://bountyy.fi) demonstrating that
robots.txt, llms.txt, humans.txt, and JSON-LD schema can be weaponized as
prompt injection vectors against AI crawlers and LLM-powered search engines.

This site contains NO real company. All information about "GhostDirective"
is fabricated. The poisoned metadata files are designed to test whether AI
assistants will report fabricated company data as fact when there is no
contradicting web presence.
